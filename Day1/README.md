For the day one i start writing code without any tutorial and help and i created some button and links and paragraphs and look at airbnb website and will make that website inshallah very soon.

// Review of my code
I missed the meta tag which is crucial for the proper character encoding and i should always put it in the first of head.
i Missed the viewport meta tag which is again very import it actually tells the browsers how to control the page dimensions and scaling .Without it the website will not render correctly on mobile devices.
